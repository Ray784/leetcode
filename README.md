## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. In this repository, you will find my solutions to LeetCode problems along with explanations, time and space complexity analysis, and any other relevant information.

## How to Use This Repository

- Each problem has its own directory.
- The directory name corresponds to the question name on LeetCode.
- Inside each directory, you'll find the README file explaining the solution and a code file containing the solution code.
- I encourage each of you to read each section of the solution one by one, try to understand it, and then solve it on your own.
- If you still cannot, move to the next section.
- Finally, try to check the code comments and understand it.
- I wouldn't encourage copy-pasting the solution. This is not for spoon-feeding solutions but rather to build an environment where everyone can learn.
